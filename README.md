For instalation and running of this example, I recommend using NPM:

https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

Once installed just clone this git repo and type the following on your favourite command line:

npm install

With all needed depedencies installed, then type:

npm start

This will compile all the scss (sass) and js files into a unified bundle css file.

Immediately your default web browser should open on localhost:8000 and you'll see the page running.
