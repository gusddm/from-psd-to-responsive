# from-psd-to-responsive

This is un example of how to start from a psd file, extract the needed assets and the build a responsive (multidevice) html web page.

For instalation and running of this example, I recommend using NPM:

https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

Once installed just clone this git repo and type the following on your favourite command line:

npm install

With all needed depedencies installed, then type:

npm run build

This will compile all the scss (sass) files into a unified bundle css file.

Finally open the index.html file on a browser and try it!
